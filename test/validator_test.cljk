  "Does the artifact check refuse for the reason it names?

  A benchmark's validator is itself a check, and a check that has only ever
  been seen to pass is not evidence of anything. Worse, the failure mode that
  matters here is silent: a validator that accepts everything looks exactly
  like a toolchain that never breaks.

  So this asserts all three outcomes against hand-assembled modules, including
  the one that is hardest to catch — a structurally perfect module that
  computes the wrong answer. Instantiating without calling would pass it."
